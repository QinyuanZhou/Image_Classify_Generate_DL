There're some interesting projects about image. 
If you're keen to explore the beauty of image processing or computer vision, I think you might like this.
## KMeansImageCompression
[Ther's simple code in python about compressing image with scikit-learn's KMeans.](https://github.com/YibaYan/ImageProjects/blob/master/KMeansImageCompression/compress_image.py)  
- One example result listed in the following. The number of cluster centroids is 3.

## PCA for dimensionality reduction
[Ther's simple code in python about PCA for dimensionality reduction with scikit-learn's PCA.](https://github.com/YibaYan/ImageProjects/blob/master/KMeansImageCompression/PCA.py)  
- We simulate 4 data clusters and process with PCA into 2 dimensions.
